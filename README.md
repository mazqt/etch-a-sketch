An application that lets you sketch things on a grid of pixels, with the resolution being variable. Project/Excercirse to learn and improve at CSS, HTML, and JS.

UPDATE
When I tried adding a background image, I ran into the issue of the blocks taking on the colour of the background or showing the image once you start sketching. I got incredibly confused at first but finally realized that the reason was that I used rgba for my shading, where the opacity was played with to adjust the colour. If I do decide to go back and fix it, I will have to change the colour implementation to HSL instead. For now, I'll move on.
